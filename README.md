## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
In recent years, with the rapid development of information technology and social networks, the rapid popularization of mobile Internet, the data generated has also increased exponentially. In the vast amount of data and information, it is particularly difficult to filter the information that users are interested in because of different interests of different users. Personalized recommendation systems can make use of big data emerging from mobile Internet and social media to serve users and predict users' preferences more accurately according to their rating data for movies, so as to actively recommend products that users may be interested in.

To implement such a personalized recommendation system, the group creates a database of 26,000,000 ratings and 750,000 tag applications applied to 45,000 movies by 270,000 users. Then we use Python to build the front-end website and back-end recommendation system. Finally, a personalized recommendation-based movie recommendation website is built.
